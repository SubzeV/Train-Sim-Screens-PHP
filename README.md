# Train Simulator Screens (TSS)
Train simulator screens is a small project to make simulations of the screens that are used in real trains from train simulator in order to use these on a physical train simulator.

## All current functioning train screens:
* TGV Classique (using debug menu only)

## All current WIP & coming soon train screens:
* TGV POS / Thalys
* Universal display
* ICE

Train simulator screen project is currently WIP

The current versions are very inefficiently coded because I have not figured out a better way yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Feel free to make your own versions and/or use it in your own train sim!
