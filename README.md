# Train Simulator Screens (TSS)
Train simulator screens is a small project to make simulations of the screens that are used in real trains from train simulator in order to use these on a physical train simulator.

## All current WIP & functioning train screens:
* TGV Classique (using debug menu only, no speed display)
* TGV POS / Thalys (using debug menu only, no speed display)

## All coming soon train screens:
* Universal display
* ICE


Train simulator screen project is currently WIP

To use this, install an Apache server or use something like XAMPP and put these files in the correct folder so they are accesible via the localhost or ip you have opened for your server. The 'index.php' should be automatically accessible. Changing the folder structure will mess up the workings of the index page and might break the others too.

The current versions are very inefficiently coded because I have not figured out a better way yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Feel free to make your own versions and/or use it in your own train sim!
