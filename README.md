# Train Simulator Screens (TSS)
Train simulator screens is a small project to make simulations of the screens that are used in real trains from train simulator in order to use these on a physical train simulator.

Train simulator screen project, currently WIP

The current versions are very inefficiently coded because I have not figured out a better way yet 🤷‍♀️

Feel free to make your own versions and/or use it in your own train sim!
